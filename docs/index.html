        <p>This web application aims to measure the noise impact to buildings near any random railway station in the UK
          and Ireland within a 500m radius. </br>
          This application is using the content of the <a href="https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/vts/overview">OS Vector
            Tile API</a> in the "Road" style to generate the map, as well as the <a
            href="https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wfs/technicalSpecification">OS
            Features API</a> product OS Zoomstack Layer, with the
          feature typenames listed below:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Zoomstack_Railway_Stations</li>
          <li>Zoomstack_District_Buildings</li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        <p>You simply select a station from the dropdown menu and it generates the following information related to the
          station </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>The total number of buildings within the radius</li>
          <li>Their total area</li>

        <p>Check the risk levels wind turbines have on birds. The risk level turbines have on woodland
          and surface water birds is calculated by finding the areas of each feature within a 5 mile
          radius of a turbine, then combined to give an overall risk score. The features used in this project are:

          <a href="hospitals.html" class="project-link">Finding the Nearest Secondary Schools to Hospitals</a>
        </h2>
        <p>This project was created in light of the coronavirus pandemic. A scenario was created to address
          a potential problem that could arise from the coronavirus, and OS Features from the DataHub API were used to
          create a hypothetical solution.

          <br><br>At the moment, hospitals are incredibly stretched and find it difficult to cope
          with the sheer number of coronavirus patients. In addition, schools are currently closed for the next few
          months.
          Another potential issue that arose was the number of patients contracting the coronavirus whilst in hospital
          for
          a non-coronavirus related issue. One possible solution to address these issues is to use schools as temporary
          'coronavirus' hospitals or quarantine centres. Patients can stay and be treated in the schools, thus, reducing
          the risk of spreading the disease. Quarantine centres have been used in countries around the world, with a
          great
          degree of success.

          <br><br>For this project, I identified the top 10 UTL areas with the most coronavirus cases as of 8th April
          2020, using
          the <a
            href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/?_ga=2.16791665.977677515.1587990158-523975224.1578581356#local-authorities">gov.uk
            website</a>
          I matched these areas with the Highways_Street Feature, and used the Sites_FunctionalSite feature to add
          hospitals
          and Secondary Schools to the map. When you click on a hospital, it will show the nearest Secondary School to
          it, and
          this distance in miles it is from the hospital. The features I used in this project are:
