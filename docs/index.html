      <p>This web application aims to measure the noise impact to buildings near any random railway station in the UK and Ireland within a 500m radius. </br>
        This application is using the content of the <a href="https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/vts/overview">OS Vector Tile API</a> in the "Road" style to generate the map, as well as the <a
          href="https://osdatahub.os.uk/docs/wfs/technicalSpecification">OS
          Features API</a> product OS Zoomstack Layer, with the
        feature typenames listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zoomstack_Railway_Stations</li>
        <li>Zoomstack_District_Buildings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can test the application by visiting <a href="osbuilding_area_ratio.html">Stations Noise impact</a>. You simply select a station from the dropdown menu and it generates the following information related to the station </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The total number of buildings within the radius</li>
        <li>Their total area</li>
        <li>The noise impact obtained by the ratio of buildings area to that of the radius</li>
      </ul>
